Installation and running the app.
prerequisites: Node and Npm are installed on the machine (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Clone the repo into a folder
2. From the top level of the app (Where package.json is) open a bash shell or CMD window (Node and npm required)
3. Run 'npm install' and wait for all packages to download
4. Then run 'npm start'
5. This will automatically start the dev server and open the default browser on port 3000
6. Please run this in Chrome as it will not run in Internet Explorer at the moment. This looks like an issue with babel settings skipping transforming node modules.


What I would have done with more time
1. Got it running on IE
2. Consolidated all the CSS better. 
3. Spent more time on the overall UI look
4. Added tests
